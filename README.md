Nodes are being updated with new core changes and will be offline for a short period.  If you have a node running, please wait for the next update and clear your blockchain to prevent a fork.  We 
will announce the offical launch here and other sources. Questions can be sent to hours@flightsystems.org.

Expect blockchain wipes until further notice.

What is Hours?
----------------

Hours is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Hours uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. Hours Core is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency.


License
-------

Hours Core is released under the terms of the MIT license. See [COPYING](COPYING) for more
information or see https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT.

Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. 





Translations
------------

We only accept translation fixes that are submitted through [Bitcoin Core's Transifex page](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/bitcoin/).
Translations are converted to Hours periodically.

Translations are periodically pulled from Transifex and merged into the git repository. See the
[translation process](doc/translation_process.md) for details on how this works.

**Important**: We do not accept translation changes as GitHub pull requests because the next
pull from Transifex would automatically overwrite them again.
