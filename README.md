Hours Core integration/staging tree
=====================================



01/08/2024 Update:

Nodes are being updated with new core changes and will be offline for a short period.  If you have a node running, please wait for the next update and clear your blockchain to prevent a fork.  We 
will announce the offical launce here and other sources. Questions can be sent to hours@flightsystems.org.

What is Hours?
----------------

Hours is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Hours uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. Hours Core is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency.


License

Hours Core is released under the terms of the MIT license. See [COPYING](COPYING) for more
information or see https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT.

Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. 





Translations
------------

We only accept translation fixes that are submitted through [Bitcoin Core's Transifex page](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/bitcoin/).
Translations are converted to Hours periodically.

Translations are periodically pulled from Transifex and merged into the git repository. See the
[translation process](doc/translation_process.md) for details on how this works.

**Important**: We do not accept translation changes as GitHub pull requests because the next
pull from Transifex would automatically overwrite them again.
